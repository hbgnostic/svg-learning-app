SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based format for vector graphics. SVG images can be scaled up or down without losing quality.  The interactivity in this app teaches users how to manipulate basic SVG properties such as position, size, and color of shapes, and understand the SVG coordinate system.
